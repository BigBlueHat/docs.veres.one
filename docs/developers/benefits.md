# Veres One Developer Benefits

There are a number of developer benefits, which are covered below, that
make developing for Veres One more enjoyable over other identity blockchains.

# Simplicity

Software that is simple tends to be more secure and easier to maintain. The
less code there is, the less there is to go wrong. The Veres One software
takes this design philosophy to heart and focuses on building software
interfaces that delight software developers in their simplicity.

# Security

Veres One's "keep it simple" design philosophy leads to simpler modules with
smaller API surfaces, which results in easier to audit code. Code that is
easier to audit is less prone to having dangerous security vulnerabilities
over time, which leads to more secure systems.

# Fit for Purpose

Veres One is a fit for purpose blockchain built specifically for identity use
cases. This means that, unlike side chains and other solutions that shoe horn
identity into the blockchain, Veres one focuses and optimizes the network for
identity-related use cases.

The [governance structure](../network/governance.md) of the blockchain is
also focused on identity-related use cases, which protects the network against
things like currency speculation that negatively impact other blockchains.

Developers need systems that they can depend on long term, which is why the
Veres One network does not integrate a cryptographic currency, currency
mining, and other destabilizing and energy intensive processes to the
blockchain.
