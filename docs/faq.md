# Frequently Asked Questions

This is a running list of frequently asked questions that the Veres One Project
receives from individuals.

## Why is the Maintainer separate from the Veres One Project?

Governments are often split into branches such as judicial, executive, and
legislative to prevent corruption. In the same way, the Veres One Project is
separated into a Maintainer (technical), Board of Governors (governance),
and Nodes (execution). Each group is responsible for a different aspect of the
ecosystem and is separated from the other such that common forms of corruption
are far more difficult to achieve if each of these groups were to operate under
the same umbrella.

## Why isn't the Maintainer required to be a non-profit?

The **Board of Governors** selects the **Maintainer** based on technical
merit and in order to help ensure that the talent pool is as large as possible,
there are no restrictions placed on the type of organization the Maintainer
can be. In order to prevent the **Maintainer** from charging exhorbitant rates,
a competitive bid process is used that allows a modest 20% profit while also
applying pressure to keep maintenance costs down.
