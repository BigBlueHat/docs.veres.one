# Veres One Maintainer Agreement Overview

The Veres One Maintainer Agreement is designed to ensure that the organization
in charge of maintaining the Veres One technology platform does so in a way that
supports the communities that depend on the ledger as directed by
The Board of Governors.

There are a number of goals that the maintainer agreement is designed to
achieve:

 * The Maintainer is a self-directed organization that is expected to
   uphold the Veres One Mission, ensure the technical correctness of the
   Veres One ledger software, and support the proper operation of the network.
 * If the current Maintainer fails to uphold its duties, it may be replaced
   by another more capable organization at the discretion of the
   Board of Governors.
 * The Maintainer may make as much as a 20% profit, but is expected to keep
   costs low in order to ensure the long-term cost effectiveness of the
   Veres One ledger.
 * Communication between the Board of Governors and the Maintainer must be
   done publicly, with minor exceptions when dealing with extremely sensitive
   security or legal issues.
