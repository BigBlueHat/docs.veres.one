There are a number of goals that the Board of Governors agreement is designed
to achieve:

   that is expected to operationalize the Veres One Mission and ensure the
   smooth socio-political and financial operation of the Network.
 * A member of the Board of Governors must not have a direct financial
   relationship or conflicting interest in the Veres One Maintainer,
   or any of the Accelerators.
 * A member of the Board of Governors is idemnified as long as they
   are operating in good faith.
 * Non-time critical Board of Governors decisions are made by consensus.
   Time critical decisions, that if not made may negatively impact the
   stability of the network, may be made by a 2/3rds majority vote.
