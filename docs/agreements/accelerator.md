# Veres One Accelerator Agreement Overview

The Veres One Accelerator Agreement is designed to ensure that a healthy
ecosystem of active Accelerators exist for the Veres One Network and that
all participants critical to the operation of the Network are properly funded.

There are a number of goals that the Accelerator Agreement is designed to
achieve:

 * The Accelerator is a self-directed organization that is granted the
   limited privilege to rapidly create and update DID Documents by the
   Veres One Project Board of Governors.
 * Accelerators that destablize the network are easily detected and culled.
 * Accelerators are able to make a profit from the services that they provide
   as long as minimum fees and percentages set by the Veres One Project Board
   of Governors are passed on to the Veres One Project for the purposes of
   funding participants critical to the operation of the Network.
 * Communication between the Board of Governors and the Accelerators must be
   done publicly, with minor exceptions when dealing with extremely sensitive
   security or legal issues.
