# Veres One and Verifiable Credentials

Credentials are a part of our daily lives; driver's licenses are used to
assert that we are capable of operating a motor vehicle, university degrees
can be used to assert our level of education, and government-issued passports
enable holders to travel between countries.

There is currently global standards work that is being undertaken at the
World Wide Web Consortium on Verifiable Credentials, which are a type of
digital credential that are cryptographically secure, privacy respecting, and
automatically verifiable.

Veres One supports these new types of Verifiable Credentials. The system enables
more secure and efficient exchange of customer and employee credentials
(ID cards, digital offers, receipts, tickets) across a wide variety of
industries (government, education, healthcare, financial services).
Other benefits include reduced risk and easier regulatory compliance.

## Issuers

Issuers enable organizations to issue digital credentials to customers and 
employees, who can optionally manage their own information. Organizations no 
longer carry the responsibility of administering their usersâ€™ sensitive data.

A digital credential is made tamper-proof through the use of advanced 
cryptography. Veres One provides the underpinning identifier and
cryptography framework that enables issuers to issue credentials to customers.

## Wallets

Wallets enable people to securely and privately store digital credentials. 
With digital wallets, one may receive credentials from Issuers and present them 
to Verifiers.

Wallets are often cloud-based, work across a variety of devices, and cannot 
be lost or stolen. Data is portable, enabling one to easily switch from one 
wallet to another.

## Verifiers

Organizations utilize Verifiers to evaluate the authenticity of digital 
credentials. Verifiers use advanced cryptography to ensure that digital 
credentials cannot be easily tampered with or forged.

In some cases, credential Issuers may also be credential Verifiers, like when 
a retailer issues a digital offer and then later verifies that offer during 
a purchase. In other cases, the Issuer and Verifier may be separate entities, 
like when a pharmacy verifies the authenticity of a digital prescription 
that was issued by a physician.
