# The Veres One Network

The Veres One Network is a collection of Nodes that maintain the decentralized
ledger and consists of a number of roles:

* **Entities** (people, organizations, and devices) use the Network to create
  and update decentralized identifiers and their associated metadata.
* **Nodes** are responsible for providing computational and storage resources
  for the Network. As the system is permissionless, any person or organization
  may run one or more Nodes.
* **Accelerators** enable entities to increase the speed at which Entities
  can create and update identifiers on the Network.
* **The Maintainer** is responsible for maintaining the Veres One software
  including continuous security review, managing community contributions,
  correcting software defects, and implementing new features.
* **The Board of Governors** is responsible for governance.
  This includes ensuring the proper execution of the Veres One Project
  mission and managing, collecting, and distributing funds according to
  the funding model.
