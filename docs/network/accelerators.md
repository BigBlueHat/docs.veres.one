# Accelerators

The goal of the Veres One Network is to be public and permissionless, meaning
that anyone may join and participate in the network to create and update
Decentralized Identifiers via software applications such as digital wallets.

There are two mechanisms for creating and updating Decentralized Identifiers
on the Network. One mechanism costs compute cycles (electricity) and the
other costs money (USD).

The compute-based approach requires you to submit a request to
the Network with an associated proof of work, which typically takes 6-9 hours
for a software application to generate. Once the Network verifies the proof
of work and comes to consensus, the Decentralized Identifier will be created.

The money-based approach is to pay an Accelerator to create a Decentralized
Identifier, which happens as quickly as the Network can come to consensus
(a few minutes).

# Fees

The Veres One Project collects proceeds from Accelerators at
[agreed upon rates](fees.md) set by the [Board of Governors](governors.md)
and distributes the funds according to current operational needs.

# Fee Exemptions

Accelerator fees will be waived by the [Board of Governors](governors.md) on
a case-by-case basis for Accelerators that provide services to humanitarian
causes such as:

* Refugee services
* Unbanked and Underbanked improvements
* Infant and Child Mortality improvements

Other humanitarian causes may be considered by emailing the Veres One
Board of Governors at governors@veres.one.

# Running an Accelerator

Approved organizations may run an Accelerator by following the instructions
provided by the
[Veres One Accelerator Software](https://github.com/veres-one/accelerator).

# Becoming an Accelerator

Since Accelerators hold a position of privilege on the Network, and because
they collect money on behalf of the Veres one Project, they must go
through an approval process.

To become an Accelerator you must:

1. Log into your Accelerator.
2. Go to "Administration/Accelerator".
3. Fill out every field that is required, and agree to the
   [Veres One Accelerator Agreement](../agreements/accelerator.md).
4. Click the "Request Accelerator Credential" button.

An individual from the Veres One Project will check the information submitted
and, if approved, will transmit the Accelerator Credential to your Accelerator.
Your Accelerator Credential will not be active until you log back into your
Accelerator and activate it.
