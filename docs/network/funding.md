   elector nodes. Elector nodes are compensated more than regular nodes
   because of the greater importance of their role in the Network.

   operation of the Network.

   positively contribute to the Veres One Mission, legal obligations, travel
   and lodging, and investments in promising new technologies that would
   further enable the Veres One Mission.
 * **Open Source and Standards** - Since the Veres One Network depends on the
   availability of non-discriminatory patent-free and royalty-free standards,
   and because royalty-free licenses are a critical component of any public
   network, a significant portion of Network revenue is set aside for projects
   that fall into this category.
 * **Founder** - Digital Bazaar is compensated for developing and releasing
   all of the core technology, governance, trademarks, and launching the Network.
