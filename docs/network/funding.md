_*In order to prevent overcompensation of the Founder, the compensation is
capped to $25M USD per year in the event that the revenue of the Network
exceeds $500M per year._

The complete set of initiatives that are funded are ordered below from
most compensated to least compensated:

 * **Network Nodes** - Network Nodes are compensated for participating in the
   consensus process. There are two types of participation; regular nodes, and
   elector nodes. Elector nodes are compensated more than regular nodes
   because of the greater importance of their role in the Network.
 * **Maintainer** - Blockchain Architectural Services is funded to maintain
   the Veres One Software and ensure the proper technical operation of the 
   Network.
 * **Non-profit** - The Veres One Project is funded to support the Board
   of Governors in [governing](governance.md) the Veres One Network.
   This includes all aspects of supporting communities that
   positively contribute to the Veres One Mission, legal obligations, travel
   and lodging, and investments in promising new technologies that would
   enable the Veres One Mission.
 * **Open Source and Standards** - Since the Veres One Network depends on the
   availability of non-discriminatory patent-free and royalty-free standards,
   and because Open Source is a critical component of any public network,
   a significant portion of Network revenue is set aside for projects that
   fall into this category.
 * **Founder** - Digital Bazaar is compensated for developing and releasing
   all of the core technology, governance, and launching the Network.
