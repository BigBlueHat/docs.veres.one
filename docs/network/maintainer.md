# The Veres One Maintainer

The Veres One Maintainer is an organization that is hired by the
Veres One Board of Directors on behalf of the Veres One Network to
maintain the
[Veres One Software](https://github.com/veres-one/). Services provided by
the Maintainer include continuous security review (and 3rd party audits),
managing community contributions, correcting software defects, and
implementing new features identified by the Network participants or
the Board of Directors.

# Why is there a Maintainer?

Governance and the alignment of incentives is a critical part of creating a
global public utility. For this reason, it is important that the technical
implementation of the blockchain and the governing body for the ledger are
separate such that no party may unduly enrich themselves or harm the Network
in any other way because of the position that they hold.

You can read more on the [Veres One Governance](governance.md) page.

# Becoming the Maintainer

The Maintainer, and its employees, are chosen based on technical competence,
a proven track record of contributing to and providing critical fixes to
the Veres One software, and providing a competitive market rate for the
services provided.

The contract that the Maintainer must agree to when selected is covered
under the [Veres One Maintainer Agreement](../agreements/maintainer.md).

# Interacting with the Maintainer

The primary mechanism of interacting with the Maintainer are by logging
issues in the [Veres One Software](https://github.com/veres-one/) repositories,
the [Veres One Project public mailing list](https://github.com/veres-one/), and
the regular held Veres One teleconferences, which are announced on the public
mailing list.
