# Governance of the Veres One Network

All technologies have a socio-political aspect which, if ignored, can have
negative repercussions on the network and society. With this in mind, the
governance around the Veres One Network is designed to carefully balance the
needs of all participants while ensuring the long-term viability of the network
for decades to come.
