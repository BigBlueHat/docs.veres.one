# Governance of the Veres One Network

All technologies have a socio-political aspect which, if ignored, can have
negative repercussions on the Network and society. With this in mind, the
governance around the Veres One Network is designed to carefully balance the
needs of all participants while ensuring the long-term viability of the network
for decades to come.

There are three critical communities when it comes to governance on the Veres One
Network: the [Network participants](nodes.md),
the [Board of Governors](governors.md), and the [Maintainer](maintainer.md).

The Board of Governors have their powers checked by the Maintainer and the
Network participants. The Maintainer has its powers checked by the Board of
Governors and the Network participants. Implementation of new features that
affect the Network require the implicit approval of the Network participants,
and the explicit approval of both the Board of Governors and the Maintainer,
making it extremely difficult for any party to make permanent decisions in a
unilateral fashion.
