            "text": "The Veres One Project\n\n\nThe Veres One Project envisions a world where people and organizations create, own, and control their online identities. The Veres One Blockchain is a fit-for-purpose blockchain optimized for identity on the Web. The network ecosystem is designed to be self sufficient through the use of a simple network utility token. The token prevents attacks against the network and rewards individuals and organizations that choose to run software to ensure proper operation of the system. Online identity is something that everyone should be able to have and create, therefore the network is global and open to the public; anyone may participate.\n\n\nThe Problem\n\n\nEvery identity you have created online does not belong to you; it belongs to someone else.\n\n\nThe Internet was not designed with interoperable identity systems in mind. This inevitably forced websites to create their own solutions, which are not interoperable.\n\n\nWhen you sign up to a website, you typically create a username and a password. The website asks you for this information so that it can start to associate data with you. This data is used to customize an experience suited to your needs. This identity and data, however, are locked away on the site; they are not portable. Even the global identifiers that websites use, such as your email address, are not owned by you. The email address \u201cyou@gmail.com\u201d isn\u2019t owned by you, it\u2019s owned by Google. You do not have control over your identity or your data.\n\n\nSince this data is not portable, you must recreate your identity from scratch on many different websites. This fractures your identity in a way that you don\u2019t control. It also means that each website has to learn about you, which invites behavior like spam, financial fraud, data siloing, data warehousing, and identity theft. Initiatives like the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) only increase the pressure to address these problems.\n\n\nThere is a desire for information sharing to reduce fraud, yet no ability for you to manage or share your own identity data. This creates a strong economic incentive for large data warehousing companies to store and sell your information, often without your consent.\n\n\nVision\n\n\nOur vision is to enable all people and organizations in the world to\n\n\n\n\ncreate and own their online identifiers, and\n\n\ncontrol their identity data and with whom they share that data.\n\n\n\n\nAchieving this vision will enable a Web where:\n\n\n\n\nOur identity and identifiers are owned and controlled by us.\n\n\nWe can more strongly authenticate our online personas, reducing fraud.\n\n\nData can be bound to identifiers under our control instead of only to websites, improving data portability.\n\n\nPrivacy can be enhanced by choosing when and with whom our information is shared.\n\n\nData sharing can be more easily reduced to the minimum required for a given interaction.\n\n\n\n\nThis vision, often referred to as Self-Sovereign Identity, is shared among a large community of people working within global organizations such as the World Wide Web Consortium, Internet Engineering Task Force, United Nations ID2020, and the Rebooting the Web of Trust project.\n\n\nMission\n\n\nThe mission of the Veres One Project is to facilitate the creation of software and provide the governance to enable anyone in the world to create and manage their own decentralized identifiers.\n\n\nSolution\n\n\nTo achieve the vision stated above, the communities working on the problem have identified a solution that is composed of three architectural layers:\n\n\n\n\nDecentralized Identity Management\n\n\nVerifiable Credentials\n\n\nDecentralized Identifiers\n\n\n\n\nThe foundational layer, Decentralized Identifiers, enables Self-Sovereign Identity which means that any person or organization in the world can create and control their own identifiers. Decentralized Identifiers are complementary to the Domain Name System that is in widespread use today where one leases identifiers instead of owning them. The second layer, Verifiable Credentials, enables one to store and control one\u2019s digital credentials such as passports, drivers licenses, educational qualifications, professional licenses, and other third-party issued credentials. Finally, the third layer is Decentralized Identity Management, which enables one to control when, under what restrictions, and with whom their identity information is shared via software applications and digital wallets.\n\n\nThe goal of the Veres One Project is to be a provider for the most foundational piece of the vision: Decentralized Identifiers.\n\n\nThe Veres One Blockchain is a fit-for-purpose blockchain built specifically for Decentralized Identifiers. This specialization enables the blockchain to be faster, more cost effective, and more privacy enhancing compared to existing blockchains that are being repurposed for identity management. The Veres One Ecosystem is:\n\n\n\n\nPublic\n - Anyone in the world may read and audit the entire contents of the ledger.\n\n\nPermissionless\n - Any person or organization in the world may create and control their identifiers.\n\n\nBased on Leaderless Consensus\n - The blockchain relies on elector collaboration, not proof of work, to determine when consensus has been finalized. Electors are selected dynamically to allow participants to join and leave the network and to ensure that there is no centralization or single point of failure for the ledger.\n\n\nBased entirely on open standards and open specifications\n - Broad implementation and interoperability can only be achieved if all aspects of the system are documented and standardized in a patent-free and royalty-free manner.\n\n\nBuilt on a stakeholder driven governance model\n - The source code and development team have a strict mission-driven focus that always puts the users of the ledger first.\n\n\nEconomically sustainable\n - A funded token model is used so that the people that run and protect the network are always financially resourced to do so. Avoiding a \u201ctragedy of the commons\u201d is essential for sound network economics.\n\n\nNon-speculative\n - Unlike other ledgers, the network token is uncapped and independent of the ledger eliminating currency speculation and ensuring predictable long term costs.\n\n\n\n\nEcosystem\n\n\nThe Veres One ecosystem consists of a number of roles:\n\n\n\n\nThe \nBoard of Governors\n is responsible for governance. This includes ensuring the proper execution of the Veres One Project mission and managing, collecting, and distributing funds according to the funding model.\n\n\nThe \nMaintainer\n is responsible for maintaining the Veres One software including continuous security review, managing community contributions, correcting software defects, and implementing new features.\n\n\nNodes\n are responsible for providing compute and storage resources for the Network.\n\n\nThe \nNetwork\n is a collection of Nodes that maintain the decentralized ledger.\n\n\nEntities\n (people, organizations, and devices) use the Network to create and update decentralized identifiers and their associated metadata.\n\n\nAccelerators\n enable entities to increase the speed at which Entities can create and update identifiers on the Network.\n\n\n\n\nEntities may use the Veres One Network to create decentralized identifiers via software applications such as digital wallets. There are two mechanisms for creating Decentralized Identifiers on the Network. Both mechanisms require roughly $1 USD to perform, which is derived from the estimated cost of running the Network. Updates to the Decentralized Identifier require roughly $0.25 USD to perform. The first approach is to pay an Accelerator to create a Decentralized Identifier, which happens as quickly as it takes the Network can come to consensus (a few minutes).  The second mechanism is to submit a creation request to the Network with an associated proof of work, which typically takes 6-9 hours for a software application to generate. Once the Network verifies the proof of work and comes to consensus, the Decentralized Identifier will be created.\n\n\nFurther Reading\n\n\nReaders that would like to learn more about this initiative may find the following more detailed documentation and specifications useful:\n\n\n\n\nVeres One Token Economics\n (coming soon) - An exploration of the the Veres One Token and ecosystem.\n\n\nVeres One Technical White Paper\n (coming soon) - A technical description of the functionality of the Veres One Blockchain.\n\n\nDecentralized Identifier Specification\n - The technical specification for Decentralized Identifiers.\n\n\nVeres One Testnet Website\n - The Veres One Testnet website used by software developers to test the website.\n\n\nVerifiable Credentials Specification\n - The technical specification for W3C Verifiable Credentials, which use Decentralized Identifiers and the Veres One Blockchain.\n\n\nSelf-Sovereign Identity Primer\n - An introduction to self-sovereign identity.\n\n\nRebooting the Web of Trust\n - The series of workshops that are incubating much of the work that led to the Veres One Blockchain.",
